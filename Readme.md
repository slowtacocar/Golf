Server for authenticating Pusher Channels

This can be easily deployed to Vercel by forking the repository and then adding the forked repository to your own Vercel account. Ensure you add the correct environment variables to the Vercel environment (PUSHER_SECRET and PUSHER_APP_ID) corresponding to a Pusher app. Go to pusher.com for more info on that.
